# Web Development Projects

This repository contains a small personal website and web development projects organized under `projects/`.

## Projects

- **portfolio**: A simple React-based portfolio page that lists projects. It is accessible from `projects/portfolio/index.html` and linked from the site navigation.

The root of the repository now includes several standalone pages:

- `index.html` &ndash; landing page
- `about.html` &ndash; more details about me
- `links.html` &ndash; links to social profiles

Each project directory can contain its own HTML, CSS, JavaScript, or React code. Feel free to add more projects in separate folders under `projects/`.
